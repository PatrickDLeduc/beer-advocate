This beer’s origins in a monk’s recipe are reflected in its heartiness. The Pope of Beers, Conrad Seidl, describes it as: “Almost black with a very slight red tone, a sensational, festive foam and truly extraordinary fragrance that at first summons up visions of greaves lard. The first taste is of mild fullness with an accompanying coffee tone, which becomes more dominant with the aftertaste. There is very little of the sweetness that is frequently to be tasted with doppelbock beer.” The Ayinger Celebrator has been ranked among the best beers of the world by the Chicago Testing Institute several times and has won numerous medals."

As solid as a rock, Andechser Doppelbock Dunkel presides over the evening meal with a colour reminiscent of dark copper with nuances of fiery red. Its clear gleaming look harmonises with its firm, fine pored head.  Also the aroma delights the connoisseur: soft roasted accents and a nuance of dried fruit carrying a vein of caramel. This Doppelbock Dunkel from Bavaria’s Holy Mountain presents a pleasant effervescence. And then there’s the unmistakable flavour: mouthcoating and velvety, strong and yet pleasantly malty – a powerful, robust body. At the same time, it develops an easily recognisable sweetness, embraced in roasted cocoa and a light, bitter hoppiness.  Concluding with a powerful punch, this Doppelbock departs with a lingering aftertaste of quality plain chocolate. A strong Doppelbock that embodies the centuries old Benedictine brewing tradition, sip by delicious sip."

Behind the dry-hopping and new name lurks the ever-beloved Hofstetten Christmas Bock.  Along with the heathy additions of Magnum, Aurora, and Select in the boil, this bock was also dry-hopped in our lager keller. This means we stuffed as many full-cone hops – fresh from the fields – as we could into a lager tank and filled the rest of the space with our bock beer. The beer was then left to mature for two months before it was once again enriched with hop oils. To preserve all the wonderful flavors developed during the process, this beer goes directly into bottles without filtration.  Light-golden in color with a mild cloudiness, our Saphir-Bock shimmers tantalizingly in the glass. The floral hop aromas harmonize perfectly with the warm ester notes. When taken to the nose, you may make out hints of mandarin, lychee, and ripe pears. On the tongue, you'll immediately be struck by the full-bodiedness. As it moves back across the palate, the hop notes open up, revealing themselves in all their glory in the finish. The pleasant fruity-bitterness travels up the throat, across the palate, and into the nose, where it is greeted, once again, by the sweet ester notes of the yeast.  This constant play between full-bodied maltiness and floral hoppiness ensures an unforgettable drinking experience."

This is just one element of many. Therefore, in the era of admiration for hops, it is sometimes worth looking at beers that focus more on malts.  We did it and we brewed our Koźlak, or Bock. An unique beer with a characteristic ruby ​​color and an essential caramel-hoppy flavor. The durable, fine-bubble head is light and only slightly tinged with the color of the beer. The aroma, of course, has hints of malty, reminiscent of dark bread. In addition, a delicate plum and raisins. Strong malt flavors are well-balanced with bitterness.  The Polish name “koźlak” is a translation from German, where “bock” means a goat. The word “bock” itself comes from the Hanseatic city of Einbeck in northern Germany. This is where, since the 13th century, strong top-fermented beer has been brewed using wheat malt and barley malt. Almost every inhabitant of this city was involved (directly or indirectly) in brewing. Great importance was attached to the quality of the beer, so the beer was always tasted before being sold. The one that did not pass the “check” was simply poured out. Such good and even quality gained fame and popularity outside the country.  We have been brewing Koźlak since 2003."

This cool fermentation produces subtle yeast derived esters and leaves a clean malty beer. In addition to this cool clean fermentation, altbiers are then lagered at cold temperatures to help smooth and refine the beer. The result of this is a very clean and hoppy red ale.  Coming in at 6.2% ABV and IBUs Little Red Cap is an easy drinking hop forward beer worthy of its heritage.

This is a very “clean” beer, with mostly German malts and a hint of flaked maize, remaining as true as possible to the original Gerst recipe.  11 IBUs"

This roasty, crisp, and refreshing quencher of a session ale updates the traditional practice of partigyle brewing. In the old days, English brewers would produce different “gyles” from the same mash: first (strongest) runnings would produce a highly intoxicating brew, and then 2nd and 3rd runnings would make more sessionable ones. In this way, they could produce several different worts from a single mash. These would often be blended to make ales of varying strengths. Seconds is brewed from the second runnings of a massive imperial stout. As is conventional for milds dating from the early to mid 20th century, it also incorporates a small amount of dark sugar. At 3%, this is the ideal convivial ale for maintaining the gentlest buzz as you savor the company of friends and family for hours on end."

You pick up touches of caramel, malt and fruity esters reminiscent of ripe banana. The beer pearls beneath a covering of dense, cream-coloured froth. A lovely lace pattern forms on the inside of the glass once emptied. The long, dry finish of this balanced, mild Trappist beer will stay with you. Trappist or Dubbel?  In 1865 the monks of Westmalle started brewing a dark Trappist beer in addition to their table beer. They adjusted the recipe in 1926, doubling the amounts of raw ingredients to produce a new, stronger beer. Dubbel is a logical name for this doubled beer, though it is more often simply called ‘Trappist’. To this day, the 1926 recipe is the basis for Westmalle Dubbel. Westmalle Dubbel: bottle and tap  We are all familiar with Westmalle Dubbel in 33 cl bottles. But around 150 carefully selected Belgian cafés and restaurants serve this beer on tap from barrels containing 20, 30 and 50 litres. In the barrel, this living beer evolves differently to emerge with a slightly sweeter taste.  Westmalle Dubbel can also be purchased in 75 cl bottles. The beer matures in a different way in a larger bottle to produce a noticeably milder finish."

Well, I guess Yukoners have been doing it for many years before we showed up, but this Olde English Ale has to make the whole thing a little more bearable.  This brew is not for the faint of heart; it doesn’t leap out and bite you (most Lead Dogs are better trained than that), but it will most certainly sneak up and knock you for a loop if given the chance (this character might be more comparable to that of the Malamute and Husky!).  Brewed to be high test, 7% alcohol by volume, the beer nonetheless drinks very smooth; the product of a careful blend of six different malts, and 2 months of aging after fermentation. The dark chocolate appearance is reminiscent of a porter, and the slightly darkened creamy head tops the look. But the first sip lets you know that this beer can be consumed, in quantity if desired (or required?), without leading to an overly full gullet.  Intricate malt flavours predominate, with a medium mouth-feel and a very light bitter. This ale promises to take the chill off after running the team in the crisp January nights."

Caramel malts show in the finish. The aromatic qualities of the beer are enhanced by “dry-hopping”, the centuries-old practice of steeping the beer with fresh hops as it undergoes a long, cold maturation. The result is a wonderfully flavorful beer, smooth, refreshing and very versatile with food.

Our inspiration from the experiences had there have been expressed most recently through Poetica and Memoria. One of my fondest memories was the discovery of true Czech dark lager (tmavé pivo). A perfect synthesis of slight roast, creamy carbonation, hinted-at hops—and immense satisfaction.  So, in October of 2018, Shaun brewed our first single-decocted dark lager and conditioned it at 3º Celsius—as we have with Poetica and Memoria—in one of our French oak puncheons for more than 3 months. The beer was then moved to stainless steel and krausened with fresh-fermenting lager to provide slow, gentle, natural carbonation.   This Wednesday, 20 February, we proudly pour for you Rhetorica.   Like Poetica and Memoria, Rhetorica furthers our exploration of wood-conditioned lagers, typifying our commitment to respectful yet forward-thinking refinement of classical brewing styles—a quiet veneration of the past that guides a progressive aspiration towards the future.   Rhetorica instantly transports me back to a warm spring day spent overlooking the Vltava and the spires of Praha from Letná Park while savoring a classic tmavé pivo—a gift, indeed.  Soft. Sincere.

Through extended, natural conditioning, not a hint of haze remains. An aggressive pour yields a thick and billowing head that clings to the side of the glass as you work your way through the pour. It is the most appealing looking beer we have made in recent memory. We taste mild chocolate, brown bread, hay, and earthy noble hops. It goes down remarkably easy while leaving a pleasant and lingering impression on your palate.

We kept going back to lengthy walks in Old Town/Stare Mesto in Prague. Cobblestone clicking of shoes, quiet echoes off low walls, and old lanterns. Zigzag streets with tight corners; maze-like. Cold, but soft and romantic. Medieval and magical and so steeped in history that it is indifferent to you and the fleeting present. Perhaps the quietness is the most striking and somehow this leads one almost inextricably into the welcome embrace of one of the many Czech pubs. Most of which in Prague are found in the lower levels and basements of age-old buildings. Some flood happened hundreds of years ago and that’s just how they are. So you walk off the street down a flight or three with twists to a cavernous dwelling thick with cigarette smoke, joyous conversation, and fast poured 0.5Ls being whisked double-handfuls to wooden tables. Nowadays, the cigarette smoke is no longer a thing, but the sense of coziness and ample stocks of rich lager remain. Czech currency is “Koruna” or “Crown” in English and beers cost 19-35 Czk. 10, 20, and 50 pieces are the best to carry and there’s no better feeling than putting down a few coins for a pivo and losing oneself in this charming din searching for the bottom of your Tübinger of Tmavý lager."

The oldest reference to zwert beer comes from 1285. However, our brewing inspiration came from a book published in 1554, which was the height of popularity for zwertbeer.

In the world of German brewing, Kräusen refers to the intense proliferation of bubbles and foam formed during fermentation of a young or “green” beer. And Aufkräusen (literally to kräusen it up), refers to a historic brewing technique in which some green beer is added to a fully-matured lager. This is a very old and very typically German tradition, and today even English-speaking brewers refer to this technique as krausening. Krausening brings the vibrant freshness of young beer to the more refined, austere flavors of a fully-matured lager.  Aecht Schlenkerla Kräusen starts out as normal Helles Schlenkerla Lager and matures for months in the old rock cellars underneath the brewery.

The combination of Cascade, Centennial, Citra and Columbus give Head High a noticeable grapefruit flavor with aromas of citrus, tropical fruits and pine.

To keep their beer from spoiling during the long voyage, English brewers fortified their traditional pale ale recipes with natural preservatives: more malted barley, for a higher alcohol content, and more hops.

For the first 3 months the beer tastes the same as a fresh pale ale, then the differing flavour compounds start to shine through and after 6 months the Brett really takes hold.  The brettanomyces yeast is particularly good at keeping hop flavours fresh for far longer than traditional brewing yeasts. The Evolver takes on a more complex character over time as the yeast and the hops combine to produce a new and exciting beer that will continue to evolve as the yeast slowly matures the beer.

Aromas of lightly roasted coffee greet the nose accompanied by dark chocolate covered berries, blooming conifers, and lemon wedges. The palate closely follows suit as an initial wave of juniper and sappy pine leads to a refreshing burst of vibrant orange peel and grapefruit zest. The back end lets the roasted malts shine through with a soft wash of smooth blonde roast coffee and fleeting cocoa. With a fluffy mouthfeel, medium body and a present yet gentile bite, Black Mettle’s supportive interplay between the hops and the malt bill makes each sip as unique as it is enjoyable.

It is an excellent companion to any cool weather occasion. It is brewed with Simcoe, Centennial, and Amarillo hops paired with a carefully considered addition of roasted malt.  Raven’s recipe and process were designed with the balance between resinous hop character and gentle roasted malt bitterness as the most important characteristic to make this beer as interesting and enjoyable as possible.  Following extended cold-conditioning, Raven pours a super dark brown to black color in the glass, leaving behind a dense and rocky head. In its aroma and taste, it conjures perceptions of citrus and pine balanced by sturdy light chocolate and roasted malt character. In spite of its relatively simple construction, it presents with a hefty amount of character and intrigue.  Raven is a beer at the heart of who we are, and what we aspire to do. It delights with its tastiness, drinkability, and hearty construct. It drinks well on its own, but it drinks particularly well with seasonally appropriate meals like smoked meat or beef stew. We expect it to age well and evolve over the next several months while being stored away in the refrigerator."

So while many thought it was an April Fool's joke when we announced Rouge, a Brut IPA blended with Pinot Noir juice and dedicated to typos, we knew it was real and it was spectacular. The label is an anagram of our name: Rogue. And it's been the most common misspelling of our brand since day one.  We can't count the times we've received phone calls for a ""Rouge Alés"" and we relish the opportunity to recount that one time our brewer's yeast was accidentally delivered to the gentleman's lounge, Club Rouge in Portland instead of Rogue Eastside Pub & Pilot Brewery. Heck, we've even been guilty of misspelling our own name once or twice. It's such a common gaffe, we've even given it a term: ""getting rouged.""  After 30 years of ""getting Rouged,"" we felt it was time to embrace our rougey roots and brew something delicious in honor of it.  Rogue Innovation Brewer Michael King started with a brut IPA, a dry but aromatic example of the IPA style, combining 2-Row Malt, Corn Flakes and Rolled Oats. For hops, he selected Mosaic, Chinook, El Dorado, Strata, Rogue Farms Alluvial. He of course used our proprietary Pacman Yeast and Newport's own Free Range Coastal Water. And for a real Rogue (Rouge?) twist on it all, he blended it with Oregon Pinot Noir juice.  The result is a crisp and semi-dry brut IPA co-fermented with Oregon Pinot Noir juice for a unique flavor and an added rouge hue. The finish is hoppy and delicious."

This beer is not intended to be the biggest or most bitter. It is meant to give you wave after wave of hoppy goodness on your palate.

Freshness and control have always been my main concern when it comes to our beer. We are committed to providing you with an unfiltered and unpasteurized hop experience. Why do I recommend that you drink it from the can? Quite simply, to ensure a delightful hop experience. The act of pouring it in a glass smells nice, but it releases the essential hop aromas that we have work so hard to retain.  If you MUST pour it into a glass, you may find that some of the hop resins have settled to the bottom -- leave them in the can while pouring.

From its first batch brewed on Congress St. in 2015 to today, this singular Double IPA stands as a landmark, watershed beer in terms of our evolution as a brewery. Conceptually, we sought to create our boldest, most daring, hoppiest beer we could possibly dream up. Our ability to conceive and brew new Double Dry Hopped Double and Triple IPAs is born out of our foundational experience brewing Headroom.  Five years later, we've taken Headroom's base recipe and ridiculous dry hop charge but applied a new hop combination in Citra and Mosaic. Thus, Legroom was born. True to our never satisfied nature, we've now matched our hoppiest beer ever (Max Headroom), by pushing Legroom's dry-hopping rates to 11 pounds per barrel.  Out of the can, Max Legroom pours a viscous, pale, pineapple-colored yellow, coating the glass as the beer is swirled. Extended cold conditioning allows for unparalleled aroma development, offering an explosively dank and hop-saturated character. We enjoy notes of pineapple gummies, mango/papaya smoothie, and fresh-squeezed citrus with a gentle buzz of vibrant pine to assist with balancing the tropical onslaught.

The beer is brewed using Citra and Mosaic hops and our favorite British malts. Truly an abundance of malty goodness.  Freshness and control have always been my main concern when it comes to our beer. We are committed to providing you with an unfiltered and unpasteurized hop experience. Why do I recommend that you drink it from can? Quite simply, to ensure a delightful hop experience. The act of pouring it in a glass smells nice, but it releases the essential hop aromas that we have worked so hard to retain.  If you MUST pour it into a glass, you may find that some of the hop resins have settled to the bottom -- leave them in the can when pouring. This beer is perishable and at its best when it is young, fresh, and hazy. Keep it cold, but not ice cold. Drink this beer today, you could be dead tomorrow ... -- John Kimmich"

Even as we grow and explore, the Street Series will always have a special connection to our roots.  The culmination of all our Street beers over the past years, The Streets is a Triple IPA brewed to celebrate our anniversary. Using the same base recipe and bumping the ABV up to 10.6%, we dry hopped with Amarillo, Mosaic, Galaxy, El Dorado, Simcoe, Nelson, Vic Secret, & Enigma. Additionally, as a nod to the neighborhood, we also added Citra to the dry hop this year, the signature hop used for our Fort Point Pale Ale  Heavily hazy and orange in appearance, The Street offers a nose rich with aromas of candied peach, tropical fruit, lime zest, pineapple and melon rind. These notes extend right through to the palate with complimentary flavors ripe apricot, orange peel, and white wine.

It’s an unassuming road leading to the priory. Here, off the corner of two intersecting roads, dedicated monks have been making beer for over 150 years. It’s always been a simple life — the kind that requires they brew only enough to sustain the activities of their monastery. In the silence of passing seasons, they pray, they brew and retire in solitary existence behind the sheltering walls. They live a most interesting life. Most likely one we couldn't sustain.  Nearby, each summer, the trellised fields spring to life as rows of resinous green cones are trained toward the heavens. Rumor is some monks love these hops and being surrounded by budding yellow aromas and the leafy pungent fields inspired them. Since we aren't sensible enough to locate our brewery near hop fields, we can only offer this blond ale in celebration of our Abbey brethren and their steadfast Devotion."

Jarl is single hopped with Citra, a vibrant and powerful American hop that gives the beer a very distinctive citrus flavour and aroma. Jarl was born out of an experiment with Citra, which was a rarely seen new variety of hop at the time, after our former Head Brewer Wil Wood got a tip off on its unique character and flavour profile.   Fyne Ales was one of the first breweries in the UK to use Citra in a brew and the results were fantastic. Jarl is now is our best selling beer and has won a number of prestigious awards, including being the current Champion Beer of Scotland.

We attempted to capture some of our sensory experience of the barn by adding ingredients found in the attic to the beer. We added bales of hay to the mash and old hops that had spent many months in burlap bags to the boil. Further providing inspiration for Reposé was Bière de Garde, a traditional French farmhouse beer that likely originated out of the stone-walled barns that dot the landscape of northern France. Bière de Garde was historically brewed in fall and winter to take advantage of cooler fermentation temperatures, and aged for months before drinking. Similarly, Reposé was brewed during February of 2014 and slowly fermented for months prior to being blended and packaged in January of 2015.   The wort for Reposé was brewed with Texas Hill Country water from our well, malted barley, hay, aged hops, and fresh hops. It was then pitched with Jester King’s unique mixed culture of brewer’s yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery. After an initial fermentation in stainless steel, Reposé was then slowly fermented for months in Brandy barrels we received from France. It is 8.3% alcohol by volume, 12 IBU, has a finishing gravity of 1.004, and was 3.25 pH at the time of bottling. The label art is by Jester King’s Josh Cockrell."

He served in the Union army at the Battle of Gettysburg. An early agricultural innovator, he held several patents for milk cooling and cream separation; if you've visited our taproom, you've likely seen a reproduction of that patent on display. He moved a house, midwinter, with horses from North Greensboro to Greensboro Village and also helped build the first road from Greensboro to Greensboro Bend.  I spent more than 6 years contemplating such a beer that might be worthy of Samuel's name. In an attempt to honor this intrepid relative, I realized that his namesake beer must be comprised of the same nuances that defined two of my favorite beers: Le Sarrasin and Vera Mae. We set out by crafting a base of buckwheat, spelt, Vermont wildflower honey, and the same hops used in both Vera and Sarrasin. Following shifting seasons of rest in wine barrels and more than a year of bottle conditioning, we are finally able to present a beer that is more than 9 years in the making and worthy of Samuel's name."

The transformation was indeed dramatic! For the first few weeks, the beer was very reminiscent of Live Oak Hefeweizen, and had a lovely clove character. But as time progressed, and native yeast and bacteria became more dominant, the beer became funky and developed barnyard aromas. After two months in the foudre, a tartness began to emerge as lactic acid producing bacteria began to convert organic compounds into organic acids. Finally, Foudreweizen continued to develop more funk and acidity as it matured in bottles, kegs, and casks during the two months prior to release.  Foudreweizen was brewed on January 15, 2015 with Austin water, malted barley, malted wheat, and hops at Live Oak Brewing Co. As mentioned, it was fermented at Jester King with Live Oak’s Hefeweizen culture and a host of microorganisms in one of our oak foudres.

The ageing process adds a fruity note, which strikes a subtle balance between the beer’s full-bodied yet complex flavour and bitterness.  The beer was first brewed in 1931 and owes its unparalleled taste to the quality of the water, the hops and the yeast used. The brewery has selected very aromatic and unique hop varieties, which hark back to the first brewmaster of Orval, who hailed from Bavaria. The beer’s aromas are very pronounced while maintaining the right level of bitterness thanks to the English method of dry hopping.  The various stages of fermentation – combined fermentation with the original yeast and with wild yeast, followed by fermentation in the bottle – mean the beer must age for some time and requires numerous quality controls."

Sunshine golden with a fluffy head and a veil of Belgian ale yeast, Singel’s tropical fruit esters complement its spicy hop aromatics. Delicate in body, Singel’s mellow, dry finish culminates a truly ethereal experience.  Hardywood Singel's stylistic inspiration originates with the Trappist brewers of western Europe, who are often celebrated for their gloriously complex dubbels and tripels, and whose devotion to crafting heavenly libations is second to none. Unknown to many, some of the Trappist brewers also brew a milder ale for daily consumption within the walls of the monastery. Hardywood Singel is our interpretation of this style.  30 IBU"

Catch a random parade, and there’s a chance someone stood right where you’re standing, watching the same parade, when Grover Cleveland was in the White House. The Krewe of Muses isn’t one of the oldest, but it is without a doubt one of the best. The all-female krewe burst onto the scene in 2001 and promptly changed the game – big, boisterous and beautiful, with a new level of energy and artistry.  It’s a crowd favorite across the city and definitely here at NOLA Brewing. So when it came time to make a Mardi Gras beer, who better to partner with than the ladies of Muses? Our Muses ale is offered during Carnival season with a portion of sales going to support the krewe’s philanthropy of choice. (In 2015, for example, it was Women With a Vision.)  Mardi Gras is a celebration for the masses, so we brewed Muses to be a beer for the masses. A Belgian-style ale, light on the palate with low bitterness, select American hops providing a mild citrus edge to the traditional Belgian yeast flavor and aroma. Notably, Muses is a full-flavored session beer so it can be enjoyed all parade long, whether from the float or from the street.  20 IBUs"

The bready, lightly caramel malt complements the hint of fruitiness contributed by the London Ale yeast, making it satisfying and authentic; the perfect flagship beer for Schlafly.  Sixteenth century brewers created amber beers by using a form of coal called coke to roast their grains. Coke burns hotter and more steadily than wood without imparting the foul odors from coal. It allowed brewers to produce caramel malts that were paler alternatives to the common brown porters. At about the same time, Flemish migrants introduced hops to English beers and soon this ale became the chosen style of England from the mid-16th century until the end of the 20th century. Today, brewers outside England have adopted the Pale Ale and made it one of the leading styles of the American craft beer movement.  25 IBU"

But what has surprised us most is that our local Yukoners have taken both of our flagship brands to heart (and to dinner, and to parties…) and drank almost equivalent quantities of each! This speaks volumes for the apparent consumer cravings for beers with flavour, and Yukon Red is all about flavour.  The first draw of the ale cools the parched lips and moistens the cheeks. Full malt body takes over the palate; not sweet, but bold, fruity and persistent. A snap of clean hop bitter grabs the back of the tongue and springs into the sinus cavity, blending with the caramel flavours that have wafted back with the nectar that is this ale. But the swallow goes down clean, almost dry, and leaves only a slight lingering presence of the abundant flavours that were just there, and now gone!  Many more draws on the mug, many more mouth-filling flavour experiences, and always that clean finish, saying “How about another?!!”.  Can you tell that this is the head brewers favourite? All you expect in a true ale, and as arresting as the Spell of the Yukon."

Th­e malt combination commonly used in Irish Red Ales brings a toasted, malty flavor that balances the citrusy and fruity character of the hops.  The Levels of Craic: Have you tried our new Irish Red IPA, The Craic? As we prepare for all things Irish for Harpoon St. Pat’s Fest on March 3rd and 4th, we thought it would only be right to give you a little bit more history about the phrase ‘the craic.’ Pronounced just like a drug, crack (crack is whack, btw!), it’s a term for news, gossip, fun, entertainment, and enjoyable conversation. You’ll often hear, “What’s the Craic” in Ireland which is like saying “What’s Happening?” But perhaps our favorite part of the word ‘craic’ is that there are actually 6 levels of craic you can reach (according to IrelandCentral.   Check ‘em out:  Level One: Good Craic – It’s an okay night out, but nothing to write home about (we don’t know why we mentioned this because honestly, St. Pat’s Fest could never be just at level one – but … the more you know).  Level Two: Mighty Craic – It’s obviously a little bit better than good craic, but we still haven’t hit the amazing level. One or two of your friends may have done something a little bit crazy. Hopefully, you caught it on Snapchat. Level Three: Savage Craic – This is getting closer to how we describe St. Pat’s. A great time with your friends; beers flowing, great bands, food, and jokes. You got a number, you gave a number, you get the idea.  Level Four: Deadly Craic –This is most likely just before you hear Shipping Up to Boston by the Dropkick Murphy’s (right?). It’s just a step about savage, but not quite the pinnacle moment.  Level Five: The craic was ninety – Wait, what? We’ve read that this phrase comes from a famous song by The Dubliners (get your Irish jig on), but essentially it’s the best night ever. Which is what we hope you’ll leave St. Pat’s fest saying.  Level Six: Minus Craic – When a night goes terribly wrong. As employee owners, we’ve seen several of our consumers (and friends, to be honest), hit this level. Don’t be that guy! So, now that you know – what level of craic are you looking for this St. Pat’s Fest?!"

Menabrea uses pure mountain water sourced high in the Alps, close to Biella. The water combines with selected barley malt and maize (corn) before adding Hallertau Magnum hops.  The addition of maize gives a lightness to the beer both in terms of color and taste and also adds a hint of sweetness, which balances the bitterness from the Hallertau hops. The combination of these ingredients brewed by the master brewer to a recipe basically unchanged since 1846 gives a beer with balanced bitterness, a floral fruity nose and a delicate pale-golden color.  This lager, like all of the Menabrea beers is matured peacefully in their underground cellars for 6 weeks. This beer has been matured in the brewery’s deep, cold cellars the same way for over 170 years."

Thus, each of the consumers becomes a co-sponsor of the purchased exhibits.  Beer is characterized by clarity and a beautiful amber color. It is balanced and its taste and aroma are very distinctive. The aroma has a solid malt base and classic Polish hops.  Lager is a style known from the Middle Ages. It is a bottom fermented beer aged at low temperatures. The name of our lager is a tribute to the outstanding astronomer and brewer from Gdańsk, Johannes Hevelius.  In respect of his contribution to Gdańsk brewing in 2011, which was announced as the year of Hevelius, we brewed a beer dedicated to him.

At the same time the ""Devyatka"" (meaning ""Nine"") popular name became the official name and is now used on the label.  The collection of the Baltika Nine brand contains about ten awards of various international contests. In spring 2008 the Baltika Extra won a silver award of the annual Superior Taste Award contest in Brussels (Belgium) that is one of the most recognized contests of product quality in the world. The jury includes representatives of prestigious European culinary institutes and the International Sommelier Association (ASI) who make ""blind testing"" of the samples of the products submitted for the contest, which guarantees an unbiased voting result. The honorary award of the ""Nine"" is another proof of the compliance of this brand’s quality with the highest international requirements.

Zwickelbier comes from the Franconia region in Germany and dates back beyond the Middle Ages. The name “Zwickelbier” stems from the sampling mug (”Zwickel” in German) mounted at the outside of the tank for assessing the brew’s progress during fermentation. The Zwickelbier style is an unfiltered lager beer (Bottom-fermenting) that traditionally is served as soon as fermentation is complete.  Kuebelbier is brewed as a pilsner and is then bottled directly from the cellars without any filtration allowing all the yeast and natural substances to enter the bottle. Unlike Kellerbier, the maturation casks of Zwickelbier are bunged (”gespundet"" in German) just before the end of the fermentation. This builds up effervescence in the brew. Our Kuebelbier is a very unique interpretation of this classic style to add robustness & character. It is quite hoppy at around 35 IBU.   The beer pours a cloudy orange-yellowish color with a nice white head. The unqiue attributes of the style come through on the palate as the flavors imparted by the yeast compliment the hop character and carbonation in the beer to create a unqiuely robust yet refreshing beer."

This process takes longer to complete but results in more complex beers from the slight caramelization of malt.  Crisp and smooth with a toasty malt backdrop, refined herbal hop notes and the fresh unfiltered presence of pure lager yeast. Unfiltered lagers leave the proteins and yeast suspended in the beer rather than filtering them out.

Last year OCEARCH was invited to speak on Nantucket and the interest that ensued by both locals and tourists was unbelievable.   The first steps were deciding on the beer, then the package and then the bait to get people to bite at retail. After sampling several styles of beer, the consensus was that a light lager would be best. Something you could enjoy on a boat or the beach, while fishing with your buddies. Samples of 4 styles of beer were shipped out to the key decision makers.  Cisco brought on HP's Aurasma software who will be powering the can. Through augmented reality, each can of Shark Tracker will allow the consumer to scan the logo on the can after downloading the OCEARCH Shark tracker app. Updates from the OCEARCH crew and exclusive video content as well as shark locations can all be viewed through your phone.  The first round of the these cans are already committed and retailers should see them throughout Mass in July & just in time for Shark Week in August.

It was also during this time that the iconic slogan, “Works Every Time,” became synonymous with the brand.

In what will likely become an exhausting pursuit of reformation and refinement, we began lagering a portion of Mary in a single French oak puncheon in our cooler. That beer became known as Poetica 1 and, shortly thereafter, we released a yet further refined version known as Poetica 2. In each of these attempts, after nearly two months, the lagered beer was moved to tank and krausened (as is all of our lager) with fresh fermenting beer in order to provide natural carbonation. We then provide nearly 3 months of further conditioning and slow carbonation in tank. In Poetica 3, we have utilized the same process but chosen to demonstrate the possibilities of a co-fermentation of Czech and German lager yeast along with a single decoction mash and a hop profile that is entirely Czech Saaz.  I am confident that we can present you with what should become a singular experience—our Pilsner has been softened, refined, and elevated.  We will continue this pursuit through further lager experimentation and you will soon see other iterations in the coming year. This is an immersion into origins, into simplicity, and a gift granted by obsessive singular possession."

Caleb and his family hand-harvested this descendent of a Moravian-Haná variety until they were able to grow that original 200g seed packet to 10,000lbs of grain and called it Edelweiss. A select number of breweries were able to brew with Edelweiss this year.  For our Edelweiss beer, we triple-decocted, coolshipped and open-fermented before it went into extended lagering, just like they might have done all those years ago.

Formerly Lager Ness Monster  This beer started with the same recipe as our Framinghammer Baltic Porter, but with a twist. During the first stage of the brewing process we mix hot water with our malted grains in our Mash Tun to extract the sugars from the grain that will later be fermented into alcohol. The resulting liquid from this process is called wort. For Lager Ness Monster we did this process once, then we refilled the Mash Tun with more grain. This second time, instead of using water to mix with the grain, we re-used our wort from the first batch and concentrated it. This allowed the wort to pick up more sugar than our normal process would allow, resulting in a 15% abv monster! This beer was brewed last spring and has been aging in bourbon barrels since."

Given the characteristics of the base beer, we selected a coffee with solid structure and complexity, and with firm acidity to provide lift and balance (Kenya Kavutiri AB). The result is truly greater than the sum of its parts. It tastes like the most beautifully harmonious cup of coffee we’ve ever had, with virtually no bitterness, and densely packed coffee flavors. It is richly flavorful without weighing down the palate, and it finishes cleanly and boldly. It challenges and rewards the palate as it is allowed to warm in the glass. We are very excited to share this beer with you as it represents everything we try to achieve as craftsman - balance, elegance, authenticity, and rich flavor that is enjoyable pint after pint, time and time again, in any circumstance. Enjoy!"

Shipwreck Porter Barrel Aged Porter ABV: 10% | IBU: 26 | SRM: 42  When our friends and neighbors at Brinley shipped us ten of the barrels used to make their Brinley Gold Shipwreck Rum from their distillery on St. Kitts, we were given the opportunity to create a beer that would take advantage of wood rather than the other way around. We looked to coax complexity out of the marriage of a barrel's soul and a brew's potential, not just to bomb a huge beer with huge flavor. The rum that lives in these barrels for four years integrates its spice to the wood so well that it ends up reminiscent of a Bananas Foster. A sturdy brown honey porter seemed the best host to receive the ghosts from Shipwreck's old home. We started with a base of deep malts looking for notes of coffee and chocolate, then enhanced them with the floral bouquet of local wildflower honey and the preservative strength of 10% ABV while keeping the body sensible. This was put in the casks to meld with the vanilla, wood, and spice notes, toned down by the oxidative effect of a year in the cellar. Drink Shipwreck Porter because a barrel should be so much more than a depth charge.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMRNXQnMTAg&list=UUnN44_ILc3y0x6WbvjLR1Kg"

Starting with a 200-year old Engelmann spruce tree felled on brewery property, we created our own kuurna (an ancient Scandinavian lauter tun) to separate the wort from the grain during brewing. The bottom of the kuurna is layered with spruce branches; the needles act as a natural filter and impart resinous oils into the wort. The hollowed-out trunk of the tree also contributes spruce essence and structure from the raw wood. The beer is made of barley & rye malts along with a sparing addition of Goschie Farms Cascade hops and is brewed just a few times per year.  SAHATI is in many ways the very definition of The Ale Apothecary, where complex flavors arrive from the very methods used for production…the result is the process impacts the flavor profile at least as much as the ingredients themselves."

The recipe for Kvasir was developed with the help of chemical, botanical and pollen evidence taken from a 3,500‐year‐old Danish drinking vessel. The vessel, made of birch bark, was found in the tomb of a leather‐clad woman Dr. Pat says was probably an upper-class dancer or priestess. The analysis pointed to the ingredients used in this unique brew: wheat, lingonberries, cranberries, myrica gale, yarrow, honey and birch syrup.  The base of Kvasir is a toasty red winter wheat, and the bog-grown berries deliver a pungent tartness. While a handful of hops is used, the earthy, bitter counterpunch to the sweet honey and birch syrup comes from the herbs."

Molecular archaeologist Dr. Patrick McGovern of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology calls on Dogfish Head to re-create another ancient beverage, and Chateau Jiahu is born.

With this insight Asahi used its brewing knowledge to develop a beer with a crisp bite, refreshing taste and clear finish to satisfied this requirement. Code named project FX, Asahi engineered a highly attenuated, highly carbonated pilsner. The later renamed product, Super Dry began sales on March 17th 1987 and gave birth to the dry beer category. The market success spawned similar competitor products and initiated what was known as the “Dry Wars” in Japan and a brief marketing fad for dry beers internationally. However Asahi has stood the test of time and now years later Super Dry continues it legacy as the world’s premier dry beer.   Special Yeast - Asahi # 318 is the proprietary ingredient used to give Super Dry its “dryness”. This special strand of yeast produces high attenuation during fermentation in conjunction with the choice grains.  Finest Ingredients – Asahi uses select grains and hops sourced worldwide based on strict criteria to maintain flavor consistency and promote sustainability. Barely with high starch content and both noble style bitter and fine aroma hops are key contributors to Super Dry’s smooth taste.   ABV 4.9-5.2% (Depends on package type and location) IBU 20 SRM 4"

But we are also “drinks people,” and many inspirations come to us out of the deep and wondrous world of cocktails. While surely invented earlier, the modern cocktail emerged in the 19th century. The original—the ur-cocktail, if you will—was the Old Fashioned. A deceptively simple drink consisting of whiskey, sugar, and bitters (stirred, not shaken), usually with a bit of citrus peel, a good Old Fashioned remains a thing of austere beauty. By the 1860s, some bartenders, Jerry Thomas (aka ""The Professor"") chief among them, became household names in America. A mixologist (believe it or not, the moniker is actually old) looking to make a name for himself would often make a change to an existing cocktail, perhaps adding absinthe, or curaçao, or a dash of maraschino liqueur. This new version would be rakishly referred to as “improved,” as the upstart barman fervently hoped to eclipse his predecessor.  Well, we’ve gone this idea one better. We have “improved” the Old Fashioned by making it into a beer. Witness our strong rye beer, suffused with various spices and peels! Wonder at its long blissful rest in WhistlePig Rye Whiskey oak barrels! Marvel at its clever infusions of bitter gentian root and enticing botanicals! And then enjoy, as you are greeted by the silky spice of rye, the firm herbal bitterness, the brightness of citrus, and the sweet warmth of oak.

Our Pale Ale is loaded with Rye malt (about 20%) which adds some viscosity, richness, and a slightly spicy finish. We use a fair bit of caramel malt for color and our American hop charge has a slight bite and piney finish. All this said, I think our Pale shares a few finer points with its sister style - Amber.

Hun Hunahpu, along with his brother Vucub Hunahpu, was tricked by the Dark Lords of the underworld and slain. Hun Hunahpu’s corpse morphed into a cacao tree, his head becoming a cacao pod, which in typically awesome mythology fashion, spit upon the hand of a young maiden named Xiquic who promptly became pregnant with the hero twins. The twins would ultimately grow up to avenge their father and uncle and defeat the Dark Lords and ascend the heavens to become the moon and sun. We brew Hunahpu's Imperial Stout once a year and release it only at the brewery on the second weekend in March. We will continue to do so until the end of the cycle.  Dark chocolate, mocha, cinnamon and molasses aromas all compete for attention on the nose, with a soft alcohol spiciness and dark fruit notes complimenting. Imposing and assertive on the palate, this imperial stout immediately presents espresso, baker’s chocolate and plum flavors that give way to cinnamon, toffee and an earthy hop quality.

The result is an unadulterated, non-adjunct barrel-aged stout that we felt best represented the collaboration of our creative minds and the quality we were striving for.  This recipe was all malt - no oats! This was something that the Half Acre crew brought to the table and is very rare for the Side Project barrel collection. The result is so awesome that we want to brew this again and add it to our barrel repertoire for blending in future blends! We also loved how the base beer matured, and we didn't make the call to ""non-adjunct"" this final beer until it reached maturity. After 2 years in Buffalo Trace barrels, the blending began and we all agreed that the best way to showcase this beer with you was just as is.

Ola Dubh was conceived in 2007. It was the first ale to be matured in whisky barrels from a named distillery and, with traceable casks and numbered bottles, it is a beer with real provenance. To make Ola Dubh 18, we take our Old Engine Oil (amped up to 10.5%) and age it for up to 6 months in casks that previously held Highland Park 18 Year Old single malt. And it is ready only when our head brewer, Stuart, deems it ready!  The initial whisky hit on the nose gives way to more delicate aromas of chocolate, fruity coffee grounds and hints of woodland berries. The flavour is a very appetising blend of sweet malts, vanilla, oak and tobacco.

A beer in which we haven't adjusted anything as far as recipe, water, hopping or fermentation since is was a homebrew.

For the 5th blend, Anabasis was put into oak on October 8th of 2018 where it rested in Blanton's and Weller 12yr barrels. After 27 months, we chose a blend which consisted of 38.4% aged in Blanton's and 61.6% aged in the Weller 12yr. Blanton's is a perennial favorite for this recipe and consistently compliments the Anabasis profile. Weller 12yr barrels have always proven successful (D2 and DM also rested in Weller 12yr), but exhibit a softer finish to the already hoppy and assertive Anabasis.

In its youth, Arctic Devil gnarls and snarls its way across the palate. Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table.  Each annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time.

In the early years of the modern brewing era, about two hundred years ago, many brewers produced a dark, strong ‘stock’ beer in the winter months, to provide a base amount of fermented beer to add to beers brewed in the rather more volatile months of the summer.  Old Peculier probably owes its origins to this.

The strong dark quadrupel beer is aged for a year in barrels in the medieval cellars of the brewery, giving the beer a unique taste development.  Depending on the origin of the barrel, this maturation will also develop different aromas. New wood of American and French origin is used, as well as reused barrels from the Whiskey, Rum Bordeaux and Calvados region.  Every year, the brewers select a unique master blend based on the different matured beers, and their evolution. Each of the barrels has its own maturation process, which means that the master blend will also differ from year to year. This leads to a unique and powerful provision beer, which, thanks to the refermentation in the bottle, will have an even longer taste evolution in the bottle.    The tannins from the barrels come in harmony with the rich notes of the special malts in the beer. In combination with the subtle taste of the wood aging, the typical spiciness and bitterness of the quadrupel is appears again.   Over the years, typical aging flavors will develop from the Maderization and Portorization of the beer. Straffe Hendrik Heritage has a shelf life of at least 10 years, since it is properly stored in the cellar: stable temperatures, and as little light or vibrations as possible.  This beer is produced in limited quantities, with special numbered bottles that are packed in a wooden box."

Now, thanks to Brewmaster Phil Leinhart and the 24 bourbon barrels he got his hands on, mullers of life’s mysteries can ponder all the more deeply.   “We’ve experimented with barrel aging in the past and had great success,” said Brewmaster Phil Leinhart. “Three Philosophers is such a lovely, complex beer and it ages so beautifully that we thought it the perfect fit for pairing with bourbon barrels. The result is exactly what we hoped for: even more complex flavors and a slightly fuller body than the standard. We’re sure this’ll be a crowd pleaser.”  Like the original, Bourbon Barrel-aged Three Philosophers pours a deep burgundy hue with a fluffy, off-white head. Patience through the aging process rewarded the brewers with flavors of caramel, raisin, dried fruit, molasses, and vanilla and aromas of oak, vanilla, and subtle hints of cherry. The body is ample but still finishes faintly dry with lingering hints of malt, bourbon, and cherry. The effects of barrel-aging, eliciting remnant alcohol from the cooperage during the aging process, escalated the ABV of the beer from 9.7% to a significant, yet sneakily subtle, 11.4% ABV.

Scotland's cold, blustery climate lends itself to the growing of barley and oats, but not to the production of hops, which are almost always added sparingly.  The yeast must work at cooler temperatures than is customary for ales, resulting in maltier, cleaner, less fruity or estery, beers. The color often comes from black roasted malt, which imparts some dryness, but because of the lower attenuation and hopping rates, Scottish ales are almost always slightly sweet and incredibly drinkable.  Ours was brewed with black roasted barley, biscuit and peat-smoked malt. It was gently hopped, fermented cool and aged cold for weeks for smoothness.

The goal was to improve the quality of Belgian beer. The winner was a new style, called ""Belge"". Due to the success in the contest, a number of brewers decided to brew the style and called it ""Speciale Belge"".  A ""Speciale Belge"" is pale amber in color (slighly darker than a pilsner) as brewers tried to copy the color of pilsner in a top fermenting ale. Later the color became darker as pilsners became very common to prove that the style is something special.  After the second world war, when the quality of life in Belgium increased, several brewers created a ""Speciale Belge"" with a higher alcohol content, called a ""Dubbel Special Belge"".  The beer has a big body, high effervescence, and a deep caramel flavor. There's a slight amount of yeast based sourness that creeps in to offer balance, with a flavor that reminds of dates or caramel covered apple. Today the ""Dubbel Speciale Belge"" no longer exists, the current higher gravity beer styles are trappist, abbey ales and so on.

The pronounced bitter-sweet taste of this beer, its gentle taste structure and characteristic amber colour are all due to the caramel malts used and the expertise and patience of the master brewer (the beer rests for four to six weeks). The high density – the proportion of malt – and the active house yeast make for one of the strongest Belgian beers, with an alcohol volume of 12%.

Another portion of the bourbon gets absorbed into the new oak barrel - this is called the ""Devil’s cut"". Therefore, the Heart of Gold beer aging in the barrel starts to absorb back some of the Devil’s Cut and hence the name ""Devil’s Heart of Gold"". We took our Heart of Gold and aged it in a Knob Creek 9-year old barrel from our friends at The Wine and Cheese Place in October 2011. The beer rested in these barrels for 7 months. 204 bottles will be released exclusively at The Wine and Cheese Place."

According to some, it is also the best, even if its characteristic acidity does not please all palates. To offset this acidity, some decided to add sugar to it. Thus faro was born. Adding sugar syrup to lambic was a revelation at the time of Bruegel. (Some even argue that without faro, Bruegel would have been deprived of inspiration and would have remained an ordinary amateur painter whose canvases couldn't even have been sold at a flea market.) Until the 19th century, faro was very prevalent in the Brussels region. Folklore there was frequently associated with it, and the divine liquid flowed like water. Then faro fell into oblivion. It was not until 1978 that our family brought it back to centre stage. Or centre Senne, as you prefer.

You literally have to forage them from the woods, and it take a lot of dedication to make up 80 lbs of these incredibly tiny berries. Our fruiting rate is 2lbs/gallon, so we hand selected a single barrel for this beer. The barrel we chose was an 18 month old Methode Lambic barrel.  Next was the logistic of fruiting this volume. Too small for our fruiting tank, we modified a barrel just for this beer, and even had a fruit screen fabricated for it. Once in the barrel, we punched the berries down twice daily quickly turning the beer into a purple so deep it looks black. After a couple months of rest in the punch down barrel, the beer was bottled. We have been sitting on those bottles for almost 9 months patiently awaiting the right time to release them.

What makes this traditional kriek special is that it is brewed with whole cherries. Since real Schaerbeek cherries are scarce, Lindemans Brewery has found their perfect equivalence elsewhere in Europe. It is deep red in colour and its foam head is slightly pink. Very refreshing, this beverage is a perfect thirst-quencher which, thanks to its fizzy and tangy flavour, is ideal as an aperitif.  In order to produce the Oude Kriek Cuvée René, the cherries ferment in lambic that is at least six months old in huge 10,000-litre oak barrels called foudres. After six months, this traditional kriek is bottled in corked 75 cl bottles. The beer will then undergo a spontaneous second fermentation process which, after a few months, will produce the carbon dioxide (CO2) to which this authentic beer owes its carbonation and distinctive foam head."

This name dates back to the Rue de Gueuze in Brussels where, for the first time, a producer offered his delicious lambic in champagne bottles. Word about the 'lambick on Rue de Gueuze' quickly got around. According to other sources, gueuze has its roots in 'gazeux' - the French word for carbonated - since traditional gueuze is a carbonated blend of different lambics.  After the Second World War, some lambic brewers devised a new production method. They filtered the beer, added sugar, saturated it (with carbon dioxide) and pasteurised it. This new gueuze, closed with a bottle cap and available in 25 cl bottles, was called capped gueuze.   Developed according to this production method, Gueuze Lindemans is a slightly sweeter version of Old Gueuze Cuvée René."

The Iris, which is only made with malt of the pale ale type (giving a more amber colour to the beer) conserves the typical flavour of the spontaneous fermentation, the complex aromas and the vinous taste.  The hopping is different too. Lambic is made with 100% dried hops, for the Iris we use 50% of dried hops and 50% of fresh hops. The latter cause a superb acidity, the former, due to their tannins, enable to conserve the beer while preserving all its qualities. After two years in the barrel, the Iris undergoes a second fresh hopping two weeks before the bottling. A linen bag, filled with hops, is soaked in the beer for two weeks. This technique, called ""cold hopping"", gives the beer a more intense savour and makes the smell and the taste more bitter.  Iris is brewed only once every season and all the beers come from the same brewing. This is why the beer is dated. The second fermentation is obtained by adding liquor. Although it is a spontaneous fermentation beer, the Iris is very different from the Lambic. The amber colour and the bitter and slightly caramelized taste make it a complex beer."

This beer could very well make you develop an addiction for spontaneous fermentation and turn your entire world upside down!   After a mechanical breakdown, 3 Fonteinen Brewery of Beersel (possibly the best Lambic blender in the world) had economic damage in the summer of 2009. The news caused such a stir in the International beer movement that I called Armand to know how things were. As he needed to sell his Lambic, I immediately got inspired to blend our New Morning with his beer. We selected three 18 month old Lambic barrels that we siphoned in a small tank on our truck. The journey back was long and hard, myself and Manuel took turns driving through Belgium, France and Italy only stopping for gas. After days hand bottling and months of maturation, the outcome has gone over and beyond our expectations and we can say with pride that it was worth it!  14°"

Made in open vats with beer of mixed fermentation, it is left to mature for four to 12 months in the cellar. Mature beer is then fortified with younger beer, so the fermentation process starts up again.  Liefmans Goudenband is a beer for storing, and just keeps improving over the years like a fine wine. Even after ten years, this dark red beer tastes as fresh as ever. You’ll immediately pick up on the wonderful aromas of caramel, apple, rhubarb, cherries and malt. On the taste buds you will find hints of apple and cherries, combined with woody notes, while the aftertaste hints at nuts and dried raisins.
