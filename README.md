# Beer Advocate
An analysis of BeerAdvocate.com's top 250 best beers.

Beer Advocate is one of the internet's most popular beer review and discussion sites, and has been around since 1996. Due to their popularity, they are also one of the most vibrant beer communities around. This project showcases my skills using web scraping and analyzes the most popular types of beers by style. I find that Stouts and IPAs are the most popular beer styles and dominate the top 250 beers (https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/).

Looking at the Canadian data, I find that the most popular beers are brewed in the most populated Canadian provinces: Quebec (34 beers), Ontario (32), and British Columbia (25). What's most surprising from this data is how low Alberta ranks on the list, with only 6 beers coming from that prairie province.

Finally, looking at which breweries have the most presence on the top 100, I find that Bellwoods Brewery and Dieu Du Ciel are neck and neck at the top, with Driftwood brewery at a distant 3rd place. Collective Arts and Unibroue, my personal favourite craft beer brands, are tied for 4th place, with 5 beers each.
