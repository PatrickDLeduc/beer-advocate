An analysis of BeerAdvocates top 250 best beers.

Beer Advocate is one of the internet's most popular beer review and discussion sites, and has been around since 1996. Due to their popularity, they are also one of the most vibrant beer communities around. This project showcases my skills using web scraping and performs a small analysis to look at what are the most popular types of beers by style. I find that Stouts and IPAs are the most popular beer styles and dominate the top 250 beers (https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/).
